<h2>pokemonlab.com</h2>

<p>
The information in this section applies to the <code>pokemonlab.com</code> web site, which is also accessible under the domains <code>poke-lab.com</code> and <code>shoddybattle.com</code>.

<h3>Web server logs</h3>

<p>The <code>pokemonlab.com</code> web site is hosted by <a href="https://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>.

For more information, see <a href="http://geeknetmedia.com/privacy-statement/">SourceForge's privacy statement</a>.</p>

<p>SourceForge makes redacted versions of its logs available to us, in which the IP addresses of visitors are partially obscured and cannot be used to identify individual visitors. We use these logs only for monitoring and maintaining the web site, including identifying areas for improvement and fixing any problems that may arise.</p>

<h3>Google Analytics</h3>

<p>
The <code>pokemonlab.com</code> web site uses <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> to collect statistical information regarding how the web site is used. This information is not personally identifiable.
</p>

<p>Google provides a Browser Add-on for all major browsers that allows you to opt-out of data collection by Google Analytics, should you want to do so. You can get the Add-on <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>. Alternatively, you can prevent <code>pokemonlab.com</code> from sending information to Google Analytics by disabling JavaScript in your browser for <code>pokemonlab.com</code> (Google Analytics requires JavaScript to work).</p>

<h2>Pok&eacute;mon Lab and Shoddy Battle</h2>

<p>The Pok&eacute;mon Lab and Shoddy Battle programs (the "software") generally do not send any information back to the developers of the software. The only exception is that some features of the software may download files from this web site. For example, the software may download images of Pok&eacute;mon from this web site in order to display those images in battles. When the software downloads files from this web site, those downloads may be logged by the SourceForge web servers, as described above. The privacy policy with respect to those logs is described above.</p>

<p>Individual server operators running the Pok&eacute;mon Lab and Shoddy Battle server software may collect information about users of their server, including IP addresses.
